In this blog post, we delve into the integration of AWS Bedrock Agent as a ChatModel within MLflow, focusing on how to
leverage Bedrock's Action Groups and Knowledge Bases to build a conversational AI application. The blog will guide you
through setting up the Bedrock Agent, configuring Action Groups to enable custom actions with Lambda, and utilizing knowledge bases
for context-aware interactions. A special emphasis is placed on implementing tracing within MLflow.
By the end of this article, you'll have a good understanding of how to combine AWS Bedrock's advanced features
with MLflow's capabilities such as agent request tracing, model tracking and consistent signatures for input examples.

## What is AWS Bedrock?

Amazon Bedrock is a managed service by AWS that simplifies the development of generative AI applications.
It provides access to a variety of foundation models (FMs) from leading AI providers through a single API,
enabling developers to build and scale AI solutions securely and efficiently.

Key Components Relevant to This Integration:

**Bedrock Agent**: At a higher level, a bedrock agent is an abstraction within bedrock that consists of a foundation model,
action groups and knowledge bases.

**Action Groups**: These are customizable sets of actions that define what tasks the Bedrock Agent can perform.
Action Groups consist of an OpenAPI Schema and Lambda functions. The OpenAI Schema is used to define APIs available
for the agent to invoke and complete tasks.

**Knowledge Bases**: Amazon Bedrock supports the creation of Knowledge Bases to implement
Retrieval Augmented Generation workflows. It consists of data sources (on S3 or webpages) and a vector store.

Bedrock agent's execution process (and the following trace is grouped as such) consists of:
**Pre-processing**
This step validated, contextualizes and categorizes user input.

**Orchestration**
This step handles interpreting of user inputs, deciding when/what tasks to perform, iteratively refines responses
via observations, rationales and augmented prompts.

**Pre-processing (Optional)**
This step formats the final response before returning to the user.

**Traces**
Each step above has an execution trace, which consists of rationale, actions, queries and observations at each step
of the agent's response. This includes inputs/outputs of action groups and knowledge base queries.

We will look at these traces in detail below.

## What is a ChatModel in MLflow?

The ChatModel class is specifically designed to make it easier to implement models that are compatible with
popular large language model (LLM) chat APIs. It enables you to seamlessly bring in your own models or agents and
leverage MLflow's functionality, even if those models aren't natively supported as a flavor in MLflow. Additionally,
it automatically defines input and output signatures based on an example input.

In the following sections, we will use ChatModel to wrap the Bedrock Agent.

For more detailed information about ChatModel, you can read the MLflow documentation
[here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/chat-model-guide/index.html) and
[here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel)

## Setting up AWS Bedrock Agent with an Action group

In this section, we will deploy all components of a bedrock agent so that we can invoke it as a `ChatModel` in MLflow.

### Prerequisites

You will need to setup following items (either via the AWS console or SDKs):

- Setting up role for the agent and Lambda function. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L148)
- Create/deploy the agent. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L191)
  - **Important**: Save the agent ID here as we will need this below.
- Creating a Lambda function. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L218)
- Configuring IAM permissions for agent-Lambda interaction. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L283) and [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L297)
- Creating an action group to link the agent and Lambda. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L312)
  - **Important**:Save the agent alias ID here as we will need this below.
- Deploy Bedrock agent with an alias. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L342)

In our case, we are going to deploy a following example action group, which calculates the specific period of time
when it's most efficient(duration, energy efficiency etc) to launch a spacecraft from Earth to Mars.

As described above, here is the OpenAPI Schema for our action group:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Mars launch window API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: API to get the Mars launch window for Mission planning.
paths:
  /get-next-mars-launch-window:
    get:
      summary: Gets the next optimal launch window to Mars based on Hohmann transfer period.
      description: Gets the next optimal launch window to Mars based on the rbital period difference in days for the Hohmann transfer to Mars.
      operationId: getNextMarsLaunchWindow
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Gets the next optimal launch window to Mars.
          content:
            "application/json":
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  next_launch_window:
                    type: string
                    description: date of the next optimal launch window to Mars
```

and here is the code deployment for action group's Lambda:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import json


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    def _next_mars_launch_window():
        current_date = datetime.now()
        # Orbital period difference in days for the Hohmann transfer to Mars (~780 days)
        hohmann_transfer_period = 780
        # Last known optimal launch window to Mars (let's use a past known window for calculation)
        # For example, let's use the successful Mars launch window on July 30, 2020
        last_optimal_window = datetime(2020, 7, 30)
        # Calculate the number of days since the last optimal window
        days_since_last_window = (current_date - last_optimal_window).days
        # Calculate the days until the next launch window
        days_until_next_window = hohmann_transfer_period - (days_since_last_window % hohmann_transfer_period)
        # Calculate the date of the next optimal launch window
        next_window_date = current_date + timedelta(days=days_until_next_window)
        return next_window_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    response = {"next_launch_window": _next_mars_launch_window()}

    response_body = {"application/json": {"body": json.dumps(response)}}

    action_response = {
        "actionGroup": event["actionGroup"],
        "apiPath": event["apiPath"],
        "httpMethod": event["httpMethod"],
        "httpStatusCode": 200,
        "responseBody": response_body,
    }

    session_attributes = event["sessionAttributes"]
    prompt_session_attributes = event["promptSessionAttributes"]

    return {
        "messageVersion": "1.0",
        "response": action_response,
        "sessionAttributes": session_attributes,
        "promptSessionAttributes": prompt_session_attributes,
    }
```

Next, we are going to wrap Bedrock agent as a ChatModel so that we can register and load it for inference.

Here are some important remarks about this `BedrockModel` implementation:

- AWS access key ID, secret key and the session token are externalized here. These need to be present in the environment before we can run inference.
  You will need to generate it for your IAM user and set them as environment variables.

```bash
aws sts get-session-token --duration-seconds 3600
```

And then set the following:

```python
import os

os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY'] = "<AccessKeyId>"
os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = "<SecretAccessKey>"
os.environ['AWS_SESSION_TOKEN'] = "<SessionToken>"

```

As noticed in the code above, these do not get logged with the model and are only set inside `load_context`.
This method is called when ChatModel is constructed. Further details are [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel.load_context)

- Bedrock agent ID and agent alias ID are passed via `model_config` that we will use below.

- boto3 module has been excluded from getting pickled. This is done via `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` where we exclude it and reset it respectively

### Log and load the BedrockModel

```python
import mlflow
import os

from mlflow.models import infer_signature

input_example = [{
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",

### Mapping Bedrock Agent Trace Data to MLflow Span Objects

In this step, we need to iterate over the data that is returned within the bedrock agent's response trace
to provide relevant mappings to create the MLflow span object.
AWS Bedrock agent's response is a flat list with trace events connected by `traceId`.
Here is the raw trace sent in the bedrock agent's response:

To fit this structure into MLflow's span, we first need to go through the raw response trace and group events by their `traceId`.
After grouping the trace events by _`traceId`_, the structure looks like this:

Each group of events with the same _`traceId`_ will contain at least two events: one of type _`modelInvocationInput`_ and
one of type _`modelInvocationOutput`_. Groups that involve action group traces will also include events of type
_`actionGroupInvocationInput`_ and _`actionGroupInvocationOutput`_. Similarly, groups that use knowledge bases will have
additional events of type _`knowledgeBaseLookupInput`_ and _`knowledgeBaseLookupOutput`_.
In the BedrockModel mentioned above, it implements an approach to parse these event groups into trace nodes.
This method allows the trace to display the reasoning behind selecting action groups/knowledge bases to answer queries and invoking
the corresponding Lambda function calls, as defined in out example OpenAPI spec above.
This structure helps to clearly show the flow of information and decision-making process that bedrock agent follows.

## Conclusion

In this blog, we explored how to integrate the AWS Bedrock Agent as an MLflow ChatModel, focusing on Action Groups,
Knowledge Bases, and Tracing. We demonstrated how to easily build a custom ChatModel using MLflow's flexible and
powerful APIs. This approach enables you to leverage MLflow's tracing and logging capabilities, even for models or
flavors that are not natively supported by MLflow.

Key Takeaways from This Blog:

- Deploying a Bedrock Agent with Action Groups as AWS Lambda Functions:
  - We covered how to set up a Bedrock Agent and implement custom actions using AWS Lambda functions within Action Groups.
- Mapping the AWS Bedrock Agent's Custom Tracing to MLflow span/trace objects:
  - We demonstrated how to convert the agent's custom tracing data into MLflow span objects for better observability.
- Logging and Loading the Bedrock Agent as an MLflow ChatModel:
  - We showed how to log the Bedrock Agent into MLflow as a _`ChatModel`_ and how to load it for future use.
- Externalizing AWS Client and Bedrock Configurations:
  - We explained how to externalize AWS client and Bedrock configurations to safeguard secrets and make it easy to adjust model settings without the need to re-log the model.
